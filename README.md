# Tech Stack
* Jupyter Notebook
* Numpy
* Pandas 
* Matplolib
* Seaborn

# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

* The dataset is imported into pandas DataFrame for the analysis.
* Initial data exploration includes examining the structure, dimensions, and columns of the DataFrame.
* Null values in the dataset are identified and addressed, ensuring the data integrity.
* The data types of specific columns are modified to facilitate analysis.
* Heat maps are plotted for finding the correlations
* Graphical representation of the data for clear understanding of the insights
